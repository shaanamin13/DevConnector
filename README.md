Recreation of following the Udemy Course: MERN-Stack-Front-to-Back by Brad Traversy.

Throughout the course I was able to develop an extensive full stack application using
MongoDB/Mongoose/Express/React/Redux/Node

I will be adding features/modifying the original application in order to solidify the concepts and my understanding of the technologies learned in this course.

# Back End

MongoDB is used to store our applications models. We use mongoose to communicate with our MongoDB. We use express to create our http requests.


# Middleware

Redux is used to manage the state changes of all the properties with the use of reducers.

body-parser and passport are used to create private routes and manage authorization.

# Front End

The front end is made with React Components. We made components for the main models of the application and broke them down into subcomponents
for better modularity. With the use of React's render() concept we can make sure to only update html elements that have been affected by state changes.
